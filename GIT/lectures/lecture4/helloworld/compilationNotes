gcc can compile to object files using gcc -c filename
then you can do the final compilation using gcc filename.o -o executablename

gcc can also compile straight to executatble using gcc filename -o executablename

if you don't pick an executable name, it will default to a (a.out on mac/linux, a.exe on windows)
